\section*{Assignment 2: Vicious Strand}

The game is puzzle adventure. A sailor wakes up in a boat ashore on the island
with a peaky mountain in the middle. During the game the main character (the
sailor) has to solve puzzles in order to find out how he appeared in this boat
unconscious and why he was left on this island. He will travel through the
island, find a small village, meet several people who will help him or point to
false direction, perhaps some monster may appear in his way, especially in one
perilous cave in the mountain which contains the most valuable secrets.
