\section*{Assignment 1: World of Portal 2}

The game of my choice is Portal 2. The events take place in the future in
certain laboratories where you are trying to escape from each laboratory and
survive.

The main game feature is giving the player the ability to make portals using
special gun. The portals allow the player to move from one place to another
omitting obstacles. The game extensively uses the physics law, introducing
different elements as the game progresses: cubes, lasers, turrets, various gels
and other elements.

The game is very interesting for the freedom of choice, the player can try to
solve puzzles in different and unexpected ways.

The world itself represents a scientific facility which has no humans except
yourself and you are accompanied by a robot who has a specific sense of humour
and makes the process of playing much more fun.

Through the game you have to use different objects to move to the next room with
the ultimate goal of getting out of the facility.
